- Tests:
  - Keplr is detected
  - `getKey` returns expected address format
  - ADR-36 message is signed and returned



## Ticket 2: Integrate SecretVaults SDK and Vault Initialization

**Use Case:**
As a user, I want my bookmarks stored privately and encrypted using Nillionâ€™s SecretVaults.

**Technical Tasks:**

- On login, initialize vault:
  ```ts
  const vault = await SecretVault.openVault({ vaultId, userAddress });
  ```

-Handle session persistence (re-open vault after reload)

**Acceptance Criteria:**

    Vault is opened and user can perform reads/writes

  ```
  `

- Re-fetch updated list on success

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Bookmark updates without page reload
- Archived bookmarks no longer appear in reading list
- Tests:
  - Toggle updates correct fields in vault
  - UI reflects new state


## Ticket 7: Implement Tag Filtering and Search

**Use Case:**
As a user, I want to search bookmarks and filter by tags to find what I need quickly.

- Call `/api/fetch-metadata?url=...` on mount
- Pre-fill form with results
- Autofocus tag and description fields

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Form behaves same as manual entry
- Tests:
  - Query param is read
  - Prefill logic is triggered


## Ticket 9: Build Chrome Browser Extension

  **Use Case:**
  As a user, I want to click a button in my browser to save the current page to Better-Pocket.

  **Technical Tasks:**
  - Create `manifest.json` (v3) with permissions for `tabs` and `activeTab`
  - Create `popup.html` with a "Save" button
  - Use `popup.js` to get current tab:
    ```js
    chrome.tabs.query({ active: true }, (tabs) => {
      chrome.tabs.create({ url: `https://better-pocket.app/add?url=${tabs[0].url}` });
    });

      Add icon and build script

  Acceptance Criteria:

      Button opens web app with current URL

      Works on any tab (https)

- Simulate Keplr `enable`, `getKey`, and `signArbitrary`
- Validate session state

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Tests confirm wallet connect, address, and signature
- Works in Chromium-based environments
